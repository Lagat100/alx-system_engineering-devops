Postmortem

Web service outage of our Web Application resulting in significant error rates and performance degradation.

Debugging Process

Issue Summary:

Duration:
- Start Time: May 5, 2024, 10:15 PM (GMT)
- End Time: May 6, 2024, 2:30 AM (GMT)

Impact:

- The service outage affected the availability of our web application, resulting in a 70% increase in error rates and significantly degraded performance for all users.

Root Cause:

- The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer, which led to an overload on one of the application servers.

Timeline:
- 10:15 PM (GMT): Issue detected as monitoring alerts indicated a spike in error rates and latency.
- 10:20 PM (GMT): Engineering team began investigation, suspecting a potential database issue due to recent updates.
- 10:45 PM (GMT): Database cluster thoroughly checked and found to be operating normally.
- 11:15 PM (GMT): Load balancer logs inspected, revealing a misconfiguration.
- 11:30 PM (GMT): Misconfiguration identified as the root cause, leading to an overload on one of the application servers.
- 11:45 PM (GMT): Incident escalated to senior engineering team for further assistance.
- 12:30 AM (GMT): Load balancer configuration corrected, restoring normal traffic distribution.
- 2:30 AM (GMT): Service fully restored, error rates and latency back to normal levels.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

- A misconfiguration in the load balancer caused an overload on one of the application servers, resulting in degraded performance and increased error rates which affected our users.

Resolution:

- The load balancer was correctly configured, restoring proper traffic distribution and alleviating the overload on the affected application server.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To be improved/fixed:
- Implement more robust monitoring for load balancer configurations.
- Review and improve the process for load balancer configuration changes.

Tasks to address the issue:
- Patch load balancer configuration to prevent similar misconfigurations.
- Implement automated checks to monitor load balancer configuration changes.
- Conduct a thorough review of all load balancer configurations to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Lessons Learned:
- It's crucial to have comprehensive monitoring in place, not only for system performance but also for configuration changes.
- Rapid escalation and collaboration among teams are essential for swift issue resolution.
- Regular review of system configurations is necessary to prevent similar incidents in the future.

This postmortem analysis serves as a valuable learning chance that allows us to strengthen our system and processes to prevent similar incident reoccurrence.
